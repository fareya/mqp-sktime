# mqp-sktime
### Abstract: 
⋅⋅⋅This project aims to explore the use of sktime toolbox for the classification of fNIRS data by developing a testing infrastructure that will allow researchers to specify an fNIRS dataset and run sktime models on the specified data set. This tool will be accompanied by a manual that presents information on how to use the tool and how to set up sktime. The tool and the manual were tested against potential users and recommendations were recorded for potential future improvements.
